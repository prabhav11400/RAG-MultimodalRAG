For example:\n","  - Query: `\"Apple\"` retrieves documents containing `\"Apple\"` but doesn't differentiate between `\"Apple the fruit\"` and `\"Apple the company\"`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Using BM25 in LangChain**\n","1. **Sparse Retrieval with BM25:**\n","   - Implemented using `BM25Retriever` in LangChain.\n","   - Simply import and set it up:\n","     ```python\n","     from langchain.retrievers import BM25Retriever\n","     retriever = BM25Retriever.from_documents(doc_list)\n","     ```\n","   - Pass your documents and queries; it computes sparse vectors automatically.\n","\n","2. **Keyword Search Example:**\n","   ```python\n","   retriever.get_relevant_documents(\"apple\")\n","   ```\n","   - Output:\n","     - Documents with the word `\"Apple\"` appear (e.g., `\"I like computers by Apple\"`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Semantic Search with Embeddings**\n","- **Embeddings:** Contextual representations of text (e.g., OpenAI embeddings).\n","- **Dense Vector Search:** Unlike BM25, embeddings match on contextual similarity (not keywords).\n","  - Query: `\"green fruit\"`\n","  - Result:\n","    - `\"I like apples\"` and `\"Apples and oranges are fruits\"` (contextually similar).\n","\n","- **LangChain Integration:**\n","   ```python\n","   from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\n","   vector_store = FAISS.load_local(\"path/to/vectorstore\")\n","   ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Combining BM25 and Embeddings: Ensemble Retriever**\n","- **Why Combine?**\n","  - BM25 is great for keyword matching.\n","  - Embeddings are great for semantic understanding.  \n","  Together, they create a **hybrid search**.\n","\n","- **Implementation in LangChain:**\n","  1. Import and configure an **ensemble retriever**.\n","  2. Combine the **BM25 retriever** and the **embedding-based retriever**.\n","  3. Define weights to prioritize keyword or semantic results:\n","     ```python\n","     from langchain.chains import EnsembleRetriever\n","     ensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(\n","         retrievers=[bm25_retriever, embedding_retriever],\n","         weights=[0.5, 0.5]  # Adjust weights as needed\n","     )\n","     ```\n","\n","- **How It Works:**  \n","  - Query: `\"green fruit\"`  \n","    - BM25 retrieves: `\"I love fruit juice\"`.\n","    - Embeddings retrieve: `\"I like apples\"`.\n","    - Hybrid result merges and re-ranks these, producing a balanced list.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Use Cases**\n","- **When Hybrid Search Helps:**\n","  - Exact terms need matching (e.g., names, IDs) **and** contextual results are crucial.\n","  - Applications in legal, medical, or large-scale document retrieval systems.\n","\n","- **When Pure Semantic Search Works:**\n","  - If exact keyword matching isn't critical, semantic search might suffice.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Key Takeaways**\n","1. BM25 excels in speed and keyword retrieval but lacks semantic understanding.\n","2. Embedding-based retrieval adds depth but can be slower.\n","3. Hybrid systems (like LangChain's ensemble retrievers) provide the best of both worlds.\n","4.
